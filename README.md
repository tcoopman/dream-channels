# Dream-Channels

**Status:** pre-alpha - will break all the time!

Websocket channel implementation for [dream](https://github.com/aantron/dream) inspired by [Phoenix Channels](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html)

The goal of this library is to build a higher level abstraction around websockets in dream to make it easy
to build webapplications that use websockets.

The design is highly inspired from Phoenix.
